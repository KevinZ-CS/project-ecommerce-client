## Project Ecommerce

Project Ecommerce is an online shopping web application where users can freely 
browse items listed on the webstore and add items to their shopping cart. After 
being satisfied with the items in their cart, the user can then checkout and securely 
pay through the Stripe payment gateway. In addition, users can create an account and leave 
reviews for items that other shoppers can view.

The frontend for this application is built using ReactJS with styling from React-
Bootstrap. Redux Toolkit is also introduced in this application for global 
state management. On the other side, the backend utilizes a Rails API and 
uses PostgreSQL as the primary database.
